Title: "The End of Time"

John and his team had successfully stopped the Timekeeper and restored the timeline, but they soon discovered that their actions had unintended consequences. They had been so focused on restoring the timeline that they had not realized that they were causing a rift in the fabric of time.

The rift was causing time to unravel and the end of time was approaching. John and his team had to work together to find a way to stop the unraveling of time and restore the balance of the universe.

They had to travel through different eras and worlds to gather information and allies, but the task was more difficult than they had expected. They had to confront powerful and ancient beings who had been manipulating time for their own purposes.

In the end, John and his team were able to restore the balance of the universe and prevent the end of time. They had saved the universe from destruction, but they had also learned a valuable lesson about the power and responsibility of time travel.
