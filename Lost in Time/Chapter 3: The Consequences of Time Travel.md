Title: "The Consequences of Time Travel"

John and his team returned to their own time, but they soon realized that their time travel had unexpected consequences. They had observed and gathered information about the past, but their actions had changed the course of history.

The team soon learned that their presence at the Battle of Waterloo had changed the outcome of the war. Napoleon had won the battle, and Europe was under his rule. The world was a vastly different place, and the team had to come to terms with the fact that they were responsible for these changes.

John and his team were faced with a difficult decision. They could either stay in their own time and live with the consequences of their actions or go back in time and try to fix their mistake.

After much debate, the team decided to go back in time and try to fix their mistake. They knew it would be a dangerous and difficult task, but they felt it was their responsibility to make things right.

The team set the time machine for the year 1815, and they arrived at the Battle of Waterloo just before it began. They used their knowledge of the future and the technology they had brought with them to change the outcome of the battle.

In the end, the team was able to change the course of history and restore the timeline. They had succeeded in their mission, but they had also learned a valuable lesson about the power and responsibility of time travel.

After their adventure, John and his team decided to disband the time travel program, and they dedicated their lives to researching the consequences of time travel. They wanted to make sure that no one would make the same mistakes that they had made.
