Title: "The Time Loop"

John and his team had successfully changed the course of history, but they soon discovered that their actions had created a paradox in the timeline. They had observed key historical events in the past, and their actions had changed the outcome of those events. But, their actions were also part of the historical events that they had observed.

The team was caught in a time loop, where their actions in the past were affecting the future, which in turn, affected the past. They had to find a way to break the loop and restore the timeline.

They spent months studying the time loop and trying to find a solution. They had to work with the alien scientists who had helped them before. Together, they were able to create a device that would allow them to observe the past without changing it.

With the device, the team was able to observe key historical events without affecting the outcome. They were able to gather information and knowledge without creating any paradoxes in the timeline.
