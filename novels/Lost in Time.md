Title: "Lost in Time"

It was the year 2050 and humanity had achieved incredible technological advancements. Time travel had become a reality and scientists had built a time machine that could take people to any point in history.

The government had set up a program to send a team of scientists back in time to observe key historical events and gather information for the present. The team consisted of five people: the leader, John, a physicist, a historian, and two engineers.

The team was sent back to the year 1815, to the Battle of Waterloo. They were to observe the battle and gather information on the technology and tactics used by the armies. However, something went wrong with the time machine and the team was sent hurtling through time and space.

They landed in a strange, unknown planet. The team soon realized that they were in the distant future, and they were the only humans on the planet. They were lost in time.

The team had to survive on this new planet and find a way back to their own time. They had to learn the language and culture of the alien inhabitants of the planet, who were more advanced than humans in technology and science.

John and his team had to work together to survive and find a way back home, as they were stranded in an unknown planet, lost in time.
